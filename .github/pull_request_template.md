Thanks for contributing to the EBC-Tutorials repository.

If you made changes any .ipynb jupyter notebook file, you have to manually check the following things before you can merge:

- [ ] Clear the output of the .ipynb files. You can do this in the jupyter frontend via `Kernel -> Restart and Clear Output`.
- [ ] Make sure you list new requirements to run the notebook. If you use a new package, say `pandas`, you have to specify it at the beginning of the tutorial.
